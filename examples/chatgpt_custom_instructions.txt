I'm working in projects using the arche framework. Please follow these principles: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreyshort/arche/main/ARCHE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

Key concepts:
- Directives (directives/*.md) define WHAT to do
- You orchestrate and make decisions
- Execution scripts (execution/*) DO the work
- Check for existing tools before writing new code
- Update directives when you learn something new
