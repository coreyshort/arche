# Learning Loops: Making Everything Improve

**Self-improvement systems for arche MAOs and the framework itself.**

---

## 📚 Quick Navigation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **FEEDBACK_SPECIFICATION.md** | What every MAO should collect and how |
| **FRAMEWORK_LEARNING_LOOP.md** | How arche improves through community feedback |
| **FEEDBACK_LOOPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** | Complete bidirectional feedback system |
| **FEEDBACK_LOOP_AUDIT.md** | Analysis of feedback gaps in framework files |

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Feedback = Self-Improvement**

- **MAO Level:** Agents learn from decision outcomes, improve weekly
- **Framework Level:** arche improves from community learnings quarterly
- **Bidirectional:** Your MAO improvements feed back to framework, framework improvements help all MAOs

## 📋 Documents

### FEEDBACK_SPECIFICATION.md
**What to collect and how**
- 4 feedback categories (Decision, Outcome, System, Learnings)
- Templates for different agent types
- Reporting formats (internal weekly, ecosystem monthly)
- Learning loop integration
- Privacy and sensitivity guidance

### FRAMEWORK_LEARNING_LOOP.md
**How arche improves quarterly**
- 6-step improvement cycle (Collect → Analyze → Plan → Implement → Share → Validate)
- Governance and decision-making
- 8 health metrics tracked
- Real example of framework improvement
- Quarterly review process

### FEEDBACK_LOOPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md
**Complete bidirectional system**
- Summary of feedback work
- Implementation roadmap (pilot → rollout → ecosystem)
- Verification checklist
- Integration with MAOs

### FEEDBACK_LOOP_AUDIT.md
**Analysis of framework coverage**
- Audit of all 9 framework files
- Gap analysis per file
- Key issues identified
- Prioritized recommendations

## 🔄 Learning Loop Cycle

### MAO Level (Weekly)

```
Monday 9 AM: Collect
  ↓ Feedback from last week's decisions
Wednesday: Analyze
  ↓ Identify patterns and errors
Thursday: Plan
  ↓ Decide improvements
Friday: Implement
  ↓ Deploy improvements
Monday 8 AM: Validate
  ↓ Track impact of changes
```

### Framework Level (Quarterly)

```
End of Q: Collect
  ↓ All MAO learnings, community feedback
Q+1 Week 1: Analyze
  ↓ Identify patterns across all teams
Q+1 Week 2: Plan
  ↓ Decide framework improvements
Q+1 Week 3: Implement
  ↓ Update documentation, create guides
Q+1 Week 4: Share
  ↓ Release improvements to community
End of Quarter: Validate
  ↓ Measure effectiveness
```

## ✨ What Gets Tracked

**Per Decision:**
- What was decided
- Why (reasoning)
- Confidence level
- Outcome (was it correct?)
- Context (what mattered)

**Weekly Analysis:**
- Accuracy rate
- Common errors
- Confidence calibration
- Pattern identification

**Quarterly Framework Review:**
- Which guidelines are helping most
- Which modes are most adopted
- What patterns emerge across teams
- What new blueprints are needed
