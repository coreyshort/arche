# GitHub Repository Discoverability Optimization

This document provides specific recommendations for making arche more discoverable on GitHub and search engines.

---

## 1. Repository About Section

**Current:** (needs verification)

**Recommended:**
```
Evolutionary framework for agentic systems. Build AI agents with proven architectural patterns: 3-layer (deterministic execution), agentic-swarm, event-driven, rl-loop. Open-source, model-agnostic, self-improving.
```

**Character count:** 220 (GitHub limit: 350)

**Key elements:**
- "Evolutionary framework" (unique positioning)
- "agentic systems" (searchable term)
- Lists mode names (specific, discoverable)
- "AI agents" (common search term)
- "Open-source, model-agnostic, self-improving" (value props)

---

## 2. GitHub Topics (Tags)

**Recommended topics** (max 20, prioritized):

**Primary (Core Identity):**
1. `ai-agents`
2. `agent-framework`
3. `agentic-systems`
4. `llm-orchestration`
5. `ai-architecture`

**Architectural Patterns:**
6. `3-layer-architecture`
7. `multi-agent-systems`
8. `event-driven`
9. `reinforcement-learning`

**Technology & Tools:**
10. `python`
11. `llm`
12. `claude`
13. `chatgpt`
14. `github-copilot`

**Use Cases:**
15. `automation`
16. `ai-workflow`
17. `prompt-engineering`

**Methodology:**
18. `self-annealing`
19. `evolutionary-framework`
20. `agent-templates`

**Why these topics:**
- Mix of popular (ai-agents, llm) and specific (3-layer-architecture, self-annealing)
- Cover what people search for AND what makes arche unique
- Include technology names for tool-specific discovery
- Use case terms for problem-driven search

## 3. GitHub Social Preview

**Repository Settings → Social Preview**

**Recommended image:** Create a simple visual showing:
- Arche logo/name
- "Evolutionary Framework for Agentic Systems"
- 4 mode icons (3-layer, agentic-swarm, event-driven, rl-loop)
- GitHub URL

**Dimensions:** 1280x640px (2:1 ratio)

**Benefits:**

**Benefits:**
- Appears in GitHub Releases tab
- Searchable
- Shows active development
- Users can reference specific versions
- Enables `--branch v1.0.0` in bootstrap

- Don't buy stars or use "star exchange" services
- Real usage and testimonials matter most
- Quality documentation > marketing hype
- Solve real problems, tell that story

**Focus on helping people:**
If arche genuinely helps developers build better agentic systems, discoverability follows naturally through:
- Word of mouth
- Organic sharing
- Search engine ranking (based on engagement)
- Community growth

This document optimizes the findability for people actively looking for solutions like arche.
