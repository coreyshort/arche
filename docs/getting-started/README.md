## 🎯 What is arche?

**arche** is a framework for building Multi-Agent Organizations (MAOs):
- Vendor-agnostic specifications for multi-agent systems
- 4 architectural modes (3-Layer, RL-Loop, Event-Driven, Agentic-Swarm)
- 8 reusable agent archetypes
- 3 production-ready domain blueprints
- Learning loops for continuous improvement
- Deploy to any vendor (Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Swarm, AutoGen, LangGraph)
