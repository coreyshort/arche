        ## Thank you for proposing an improvement!
        
        This template helps capture improvements with enough detail for automated implementation.
        
        **Types of improvements:**
        - Improvements to existing modes/forms
        - New features or better patterns
        - Documentation and discoverability
        - **New mode proposals** (when real-world patterns emerge)
        
        **How this works:**
        1. You submit this issue with implementation details
        2. Issue is automatically labeled by category/priority
        3. Arche maintainer reviews and adds `status:approved` label
        4. GitHub Actions automatically creates a PR with your changes
        5. Maintainer reviews and merges the PR
        
        **You do not need write access to the repository**—just the ability to create issues.
