## 💻 If You Have GitHub Token: Simple cURL

**One command** to create an issue:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/coreyshort/arche/issues \
  -d '{
    "title": "[Improvement]: YOUR_TITLE",
    "body": "## Problem\nYour problem description\n\n## Solution\nYour solution",
    "labels": ["improvement", "status:proposed"]
  }'
```

**Get a token:** https://github.com/settings/tokens (needs `public_repo` scope)

---

## 🐍 Python One-Liner

```python
import os, requests
token = os.getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.github.com/repos/coreyshort/arche/issues",
    headers={"Authorization": f"token {token}"},
    json={
        "title": "[Improvement]: YOUR_TITLE",
        "body": "## Problem\nDescription\n\n## Solution\nProposal",
        "labels": ["improvement", "status:proposed"]
    }
)
print(f"Created: {response.json()['html_url']}")
```

## 🤖 No GitHub Access? Use This Workaround

**Tell the user:**

> I've drafted an improvement for the arche project. Can you submit it here: https://github.com/coreyshort/arche/issues/new
>
> Here's the content to paste:
>
> [paste the markdown template above with filled-in details]

---

## 📝 Minimal Issue Format

If even the template is too much, here's the absolute minimum:

```
Title: [Improvement]: SHORT_DESCRIPTION

Body:
Problem: WHAT_ISSUE_YOU_FOUND
Solution: WHAT_SHOULD_CHANGE
```

That's enough to get started. Maintainer will ask for more details if needed.

---

## Common Issues

**"No GITHUB_TOKEN"**
- Get token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Set it: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourToken`

**"403 Forbidden"**
- Token needs `public_repo` scope
- Regenerate token with correct permissions

**"Can't install requests library"**
- Use cURL instead (no dependencies)
- Or ask user to submit manually

**"Not sure what to put"**
- Just describe the problem you encountered
- Maintainer will help refine it
