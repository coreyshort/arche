# New Mode Proposal Template

Use this when proposing a new architectural mode for arche based on emerging real-world patterns.

## Mode Name

Brief, descriptive name (e.g., "agent-mesh", "federated-learning", "quantum-enhanced")

## Proposed Maturity Level

New modes start at **🌱 Proposed** status. This proposal aims to advance to:
- [ ] 🔨 Experimental (structure created, early adopters shaping patterns)
- [ ] 🚀 Emerging (production-proven, patterns stabilizing)

See [MODE_MATURITY.md](../MODE_MATURITY.md) for definitions.

## Paradigm Summary

One-sentence description of the core paradigm (e.g., "Agents coordinating through decentralized mesh network")

## Real-World Evidence

**Critical:** New modes must emerge from production use, not theory.

Provide concrete examples:
- Production systems using this pattern
- Industry trends demonstrating adoption
- Specific projects/companies validating this approach
- Links to relevant implementations, papers, or frameworks

## Problem This Mode Solves

What problems do existing modes (3-layer, agentic-swarm, event-driven, rl-loop) NOT address?

Why can't these use cases be satisfied by adding forms to existing modes?

## When to Use This Mode

**Best for:**
- (List specific use cases)
- (Projects with these characteristics)
- (Industries/domains where this pattern fits)

**Not appropriate when:**
- (Situations where existing modes work better)

## Proposed Structure

### Shared Components (_shared/)
What files would all forms in this mode need?
- Instructions for AI assistants working in this mode
- Common patterns/utilities
- Mode-specific principles

### Initial Forms
What project types would benefit from this mode?
- form-name-1: Description
- form-name-2: Description

### Self-Annealing Loop
How would projects in this mode improve over time?
- Within-project improvements
- Cross-ecosystem learning

## Architecture Pattern (Conceptual)

Describe the fundamental pattern:
```
User Intent
    ↓
[How this mode processes/responds]
    ↓
[Key components/flow]
    ↓
Output/Outcome
```

## Maturity Assessment

- **Production examples:** (How many? Who's using it?)
- **Stability:** (Is the pattern proven or still experimental?)
- **Community:** (Are frameworks/tools emerging around this?)
- **Readiness:** (Is it mature enough for arche to capture as a mode?)

## Implementation Notes

Initial thoughts on:
- What existing frameworks/tools support this pattern?
- What would INSTRUCTIONS.md for this mode teach AI assistants?
- What forms would provide immediate value?
- What challenges exist in capturing this as a mode?

## Related Work

- Existing frameworks implementing this pattern
- Research or case studies
- Companies/projects pioneering this approach

**Remember:** Arche is generative, not prescriptive. New modes expand the framework without invalidating existing ones. Each mode should represent a fundamentally different architectural paradigm, not just variations on existing modes.
