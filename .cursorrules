# Arche Framework Instructions

Follow the arche framework for reliable AI-assisted development.

## Choose Your Mode

Arche supports multiple architectural modes. Choose based on your project:

**For most projects (mature, proven):**

**For multi-agent systems (emerging):**

**For event-driven systems (emerging):**

## Quick Reference (3-Layer Mode)

- **Layer 1 (Directives):** Read `directives/*.md` to understand what to do
- **Layer 2 (Orchestration):** You make intelligent decisions and route between tools
- **Layer 3 (Execution):** Call scripts in `execution/` to do the actual work

Check for existing tools before writing new code. Update directives as you learn. Self-anneal when things break.
