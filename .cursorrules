## Quick Reference

- **Layer 1 (Directives):** Read `directives/*.md` to understand what to do
- **Layer 2 (Orchestration):** You make intelligent decisions and route between tools
- **Layer 3 (Execution):** Call scripts in `execution/` to do the actual work

Check for existing tools before writing new code. Update directives as you learn. Self-anneal when things break.
