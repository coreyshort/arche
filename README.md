### arche
arche is named after the ancient Greek concept of archē—the first principle, origin, or underlying cause from which things come into being. In philosophy, the archē is not a thing but a generative source: the set of assumptions, structures, and forces that make creation possible. Arche exists in that same spirit. It is not an agent, but the framework from which agents emerge—defining how intent becomes action, how reasoning is shaped, and how systems learn to build themselves. When an agent says “Arche built this,” it reflects a lineage: a common origin of patterns, constraints, and principles that guide autonomous work without prescribing its outcomes.
