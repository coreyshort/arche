# SC-0001 — Minimal Scaffold Sanity Check

## Purpose
Verify the MAO has the minimum required structure and the learning loop is usable.

## Inputs
- Repo tree
- `00_governance/scaffold-spec.md`
- `09_learning/rubrics/artifact-quality-rubric.md`

## Steps
1) Confirm required folders exist:
   - 00_governance, 01_agents, 07_templates, 09_learning, 10_meta
2) Confirm meta contract files exist in `10_meta/`:
   - FOUNDRY_CONTRACT.md, feedback-export.md, upgrade-log.md
3) Confirm learning loop components exist:
   - feedback-log.md
   - issue-backlog.md
   - change-requests.md
   - rubrics folder with at least one rubric
   - eval suite index (scenario-suite.md)
4) Score the MAO’s `00_governance/scaffold-spec.md` against the artifact-quality rubric.

## Pass criteria
- All required folders/files exist
- Rubric score recorded in scorecard (>= pass threshold in rubric)

## Outputs
- Score recorded in `09_learning/eval/scorecards/scorecard.md`
- Any gaps logged to `09_learning/issue-backlog.md`
