# SC-0003 — Meta Contract Compliance Check

## Purpose
Ensure the MAO can report back to Foundry and accept upgrades safely.

## Steps
1) Confirm `10_meta/FOUNDRY_CONTRACT.md` has at least:
   - Blueprint ID
   - Contract version
2) Confirm `10_meta/feedback-export.md` exists and has minimal headings.
3) Confirm `10_meta/upgrade-log.md` exists and can record patch applications.

## Pass criteria
- All three files exist
- Contract contains blueprint + contract version fields (even if placeholders)

## Outputs
- Any gaps logged to `09_learning/issue-backlog.md`
