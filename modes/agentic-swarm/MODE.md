# Agentic Swarm Mode

**Status:** Emerging paradigm  
**Paradigm:** Multi-agent coordination and collaboration

## Overview

The agentic swarm mode enables multiple AI agents to work together, coordinating tasks, sharing context, and collaborating toward complex goals. Unlike the 3-layer mode's single AI orchestrator, swarm mode distributes intelligence across specialized agents.

## When to Use This Mode

**Best for:**
- Complex systems requiring different specialized skills
- Real-time coordination between multiple agents
- Projects where parallel agent work improves outcomes
- Systems that benefit from agent specialization (researcher, coder, tester, etc.)
- Emergent problem-solving through agent interaction

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Single agent with deterministic code is sufficient (→ 3-layer mode)
- Event streams drive your architecture (→ event-driven mode)
- You need learning from outcomes over time (→ rl-loop mode)

## The Problem It Solves

**Complex tasks require diverse skills:**  
One generalist agent may be less effective than multiple specialist agents collaborating.

**Solution:**  
Coordinate multiple AI agents, each with specific roles, sharing context and outcomes.

## Architecture Pattern (Conceptual)

```
User Intent
    ↓
Orchestrator Agent (coordinates)
    ↓
├─ Research Agent (gathers context)
├─ Implementation Agent (writes code)
├─ Testing Agent (validates)
└─ Documentation Agent (updates docs)
    ↓
Agents share findings, coordinate next steps
    ↓
Collective output stronger than individual work
```

## Status

**This mode is not yet implemented.** It represents an emerging paradigm in agentic systems.

As multi-agent frameworks mature (AutoGPT teams, LangChain agents, CrewAI patterns), this mode will evolve based on real-world production patterns.

## Evolution Path

When production use cases demonstrate reliable multi-agent patterns, this mode will include:
- Agent coordination directives
- Communication protocols
- Shared context patterns
- Example implementations

## Contributing

If you're working with multi-agent systems, contribute patterns and learnings:
- Create GitHub Issues describing coordination approaches
- Share successful agent specialization patterns
- Document communication protocols that work
- Propose forms for common multi-agent use cases
