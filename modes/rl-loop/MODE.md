# Reinforcement Learning Loop Mode

**Maturity:** 🚀 Emerging  
**Paradigm:** Agents learning from outcomes over time  
**Production Projects:** Patterns being discovered  
**Last Status Update:** December 2025

## Overview

The reinforcement learning loop mode enables agents to improve through experience, learning which actions lead to better outcomes and adapting their behavior based on reward signals.

## When to Use This Mode

**Best for:**
- Optimization problems where best approach isn't known upfront
- Systems that improve with usage (recommendation engines, personalization)
- Agents that should adapt to user preferences over time
- Environments where exploration and exploitation matter
- Long-running systems that benefit from continuous learning

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Deterministic, predictable behavior is required (→ 3-layer mode)
- Multiple agents coordinate without learning (→ agentic-swarm mode)
- Event streams drive the architecture (→ event-driven mode)

## The Problem It Solves

**Static agents don't improve:**  
Traditional agent systems execute the same patterns regardless of outcomes. They don't learn which approaches work better over time.

**Solution:**  
Structure agents around reward signals, outcome tracking, and policy updates. Agents try actions, observe results, and improve their decision-making.

## Architecture Pattern (Conceptual)

```
Agent observes state
    ↓
Agent takes action (based on current policy)
    ↓
Environment/System responds
    ↓
Reward signal generated (success metrics)
    ↓
Agent updates policy (learn from outcome)
    ↓
Over time: Better actions → Higher rewards
```

## Status

**This mode is not yet implemented.** It represents an emerging paradigm in agentic systems.

As RL-based agent frameworks mature (RLHF, agent fine-tuning, outcome-driven learning), this mode will evolve based on real-world production patterns.

## Evolution Path

When production use cases demonstrate reliable RL agent patterns, this mode will include:
- Reward function directives
- Policy update patterns
- State observation protocols
- Example implementations (optimization agents, adaptive systems)

## Contributing

If you're building RL-based agent systems, contribute patterns and learnings:
- Create GitHub Issues describing reward structures
- Share successful policy update patterns
- Document state representations and action spaces
- Propose forms for common RL agent use cases
