# Foundry Rubric (Meta-Quality)

Score 0–2 per dimension.

1) **Completeness**
- Required folders/files for a MAO are present (00_governance, 01_agents, 07_templates, 09_learning, 10_meta)

2) **Ownership clarity**
- Every major file has an owner agent; shared change path exists (CRs)

3) **Learning loop health**
- Rubrics exist, eval suite exists (≥3), scorecards exist, and operating cadence is stated

4) **Dimension handling**
- Dimensions are explicit; deltas are captured via profiles/translation rules or equivalents

5) **Footprint discipline**
- Near-term agent set is small and sufficient; ideal set is optional and justified

6) **Mirror-ready**
- Mode is self-contained; no hard dependency outside `modes/foundry/`

Pass: no 0s in 1–3 and average ≥ 1.6.
