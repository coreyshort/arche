# Dimensions Checklist

Foundry proposes dimensions; user selects 3–6 for v1.

## Common dimensions
- Industry/sector variations
- Persona/discipline variations
- Lifecycle stages
- Risk posture & criticality
- Compliance/audit requirements
- Data sources and integrations
- Operating model (central vs pods)
- Cadence (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Output formats (briefs, PRDs, runbooks, etc.)
- Tooling constraints (repo-only, ticketing, docs)

## Rule
Start narrow; add dimensions only when they materially change language/requirements.
