## Foundry (new mode)
- **What it is:** A meta-agent mode that generates **self-learning multi-agent scaffolds** (agents + templates + governance + eval + feedback loops).
- **Use when:** You need to create a new multi-agent organization quickly (e.g., product mgmt, incident response, data ops, safety audits).
- **Don't use when:** You only need a single-agent directive or a small, fixed workflow.
- **Entry point:** `modes/foundry/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **Outputs:** A repo scaffold containing `00_governance/`, `01_agents/`, `07_templates/`, `09_learning/`, and a contract folder `10_meta/`.
