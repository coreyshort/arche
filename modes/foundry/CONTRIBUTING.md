# Contributing to Foundry (inside arche)

## Where to file issues and PRs
- File issues and PRs in the **arche** repository (Foundry is a mode).
- If/when Foundry becomes a mirrored repo later, the mirror should redirect here.

## What makes a good Foundry issue
- Objective + domain
- Blueprint ID (if applicable)
- What output was missing or wrong
- Suggested patch/heuristic change
- If it affects generated MAOs: include an example tree and rubric failure
